🎨 Project: “CSS Card Flip Grid” 🃏

💡 Goals:

Make a grid of cards.

Each card flips on hover to show a message or fun fact.

Use CSS transitions, transforms, and flexbox.

Make it colourful and playful — maybe gradients, shadows, or rounded corners.

🔥 Tips while doing it:

Think about hover effects — scale, rotate, shadow.

Experiment with different background colors and fonts to make it pop.

Try to center the grid and make it responsive for small screens.
